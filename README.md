# provision ðŸ¥§

This is a forked flake for provisioning CanSats with Raspberry Pi boards.
It provides a minimal NixOS setup that boots headlessly with SSH and Wi-Fi.

For usage, build the sd-image:

```shell
nix build '.#nixosConfigurations.mach25.config.system.build.sdImage'
```

Then write the image to an SD card:

```shell
dd if=result/sd-image/nixos-sd-image-21.11pre-git-aarch64-linux.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

Replace `/dev/sdX` with the correct device path.
